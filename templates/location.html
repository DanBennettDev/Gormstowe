<!-- <p>In progress - stepping stone in development - the page that loads when you click a map location - allows uploading of files and viewing of a scene generated by files already uploaded at this location. Goal is to have this as the sole interface, a scrolling map ala google maps
with layers of images scrolling in parallax.

Ctrl click to set position

	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>This is a shared space for uploading pictures and text, (and eventually sound)
	to build a collaborative web fiction. </p>

	<p>Images may have text attached - indicated by "[...]". If you see one of these you may click to expand the text</p>
	<p><strong>To add your own content: </strong> hold control and click on location to place content. A menu will appear allowing you to complete your upload</p>
	<p>If the current page is blank then you have found an untouched region of the map. Feel free to leave something, or just move somewhere else using the arrows at the edge of the screen</p>
	<p><em>My goal is to add foreground and background layers, with parallax scrolling, and make the map draggable, like google maps. Also users will be able to have their images processed. Further in the future (beyond the scope of this project) I want users to be able to tag images, and create links between images to create "routes" through the content, which will show up as threads drawn on screen creating a kind of narrative, showing on optional layers which users can turn on or off </p>
	<p>The images, etc. here at the moment are just what was hanging around and things I'd already made for the front page</em></p>
